# battleship

**battleship** is a turn-based game built with React 19 + Vite, featuring dynamic ship placement, turn logic, and responsive UI. But this project is not just a game - I went deep on testing, game logic, and component isolation, writing unit tests with Vitest and React Testing Library to ensure every move, render, and game state works perfectly.
